- 2 - 4 player game where players control a tank and the objective is to be the last tank alive
- Top down view at an angle 
- Tank shells richochet off the walls
- Tanks can only shoot a limited number of projectiles at a time
- Power-ups placed on the map to add new abilities
- Maybe use different tank types with different perks or different shell types
- Different map styles and terrain to offer varying gameplay
- Tanks will be different colors or have unique characters on top to distinguish between players
